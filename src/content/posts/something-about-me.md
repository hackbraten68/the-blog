This blog is my little corner of the internet where I post dev tips, self-hosting guides, and general tech ramblings â€” basically, if it runs on Linux and can live in a Docker container, Iâ€™ve probably tried it at 2am.

Expect tutorials, rants, config files that may or may not work on the first try, and the occasional meme to keep the sanity in check.

â€“ Me, deploying to production for fun

> If you're into building things yourself, tinkering with servers, or just want to vibe with someone who also yells at YAML files, youâ€™re in the right place.


## Fun Facts:

- I run multiple services on a Raspberry Pi 4B and a Zero 2 W â€” because who doesnâ€™t want a tiny data center on their desk?
- Favorite tools? tmux, lazydocker, and DietPi OS â€“ minimalism meets power.
- I talk to my terminal more than I talk to people.
- Dark mode is not a preference, it's a lifestyle.
- Iâ€™m currently switching from VS Code to WebStorm. Itâ€™s a journey. A loud, JetBrains-powered journey.
- I have trust issues... thanks to docker-compose.yaml indentation errors.
- I once burned a SD Card by trying to migrate a 90 GB Google Fotos Library. 10/10 would do it again.

## What I'm working on

- Ditching US tech services like Google, one self-hosted alternative at a time. Privacy matters.
- Experimenting with Deno in smaller projects â€“ because why not try something faster, lighter, and fresh?
